# MeinRecipe

"MeinRecipe" is invented to assist people who are annoyed by always having the necessity of writing grocery lists and carrying everything home from the supermarket. And it also resolves the confusion of having a few ingredients left but canâ€™t imagine how to create something taste based on the existing ingredients.
